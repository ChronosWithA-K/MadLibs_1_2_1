# AP CSA MadLibs 1.2.10 

## This repo is meant to be able to solve any madlib, provided the prompts for said madlib are contained within angle brackets ("<", ">").

### Time Chart
| Milestones | Estimated development time | Actual development time |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Create the madlib riddles | 1 minute | 1 minute |
| Find each part of speech to replace | 5 minutes | 12 minutes |
| Show each part of speech to the user | 2 minutes | 3 minutes |
| Get the user's response | 15 minutes | 25 minutes |
| Create/show the finished madlib |10 minutes | 23 minutes |

The estimated development times and the actual development time follow the rule of things taking twice as long as expected.

### Goals
 - ~~Be able to solve madlibs with more than/less than three prompts~~
 - ~~Be able to check whether an answer is legal (alphabetical characters only)~~
 - ~~Finish~~

### Challenges
 - It was a bit hard to figure out why I was prompted for the same thing over and over (Spoiler alert - I used "+" instead of a ",".).
 - The legalityChecker() method took a while to write, mostly because I had to figure out what the syntax was.
